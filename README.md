## About Me

I'm an avid thinker and tinker. This means I ruminate (occasionally)‚Äîwhich helps with
my passion for the creatives, like tech. I enjoy learning new things everyday, reading current events,
meeting new people, and coming up with novel solutions that can better user experiences.
At the moment I'm trying to solve a pesky "little" problem called "R" or procrasination
with a new and original system that I've creatively called **[Redacted]**. üòâ

I am currently seeking a full-time position in software development, where I can apply
and elevate my skills so that I may meet today's challenges head-on. Danke! üôá
